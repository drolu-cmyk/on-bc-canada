# Runtime reference implementations

The runtime folder keeps provider-neutral contracts executable before cloud services or model providers are allowed to create side effects.

## Control plane

`control_plane.py` is the enrollment-to-onboarding reference slice. It preserves versioned events, idempotency, privacy boundaries, and human-review routes.

## Graph kernel

`graph_kernel.py` adds the common execution primitive for autonomous work. The graph controls sequencing and authority. A node may be deterministic code, an agent, or a human decision. The kernel provides:

- versioned graph definitions;
- conditional edges;
- mutable execution state with immutable checkpoints;
- node evidence;
- evaluator gates;
- human approval interrupts;
- execution traces through the existing hash-chained event ledger;
- idempotent execution creation.

The graph kernel does not call a model by itself. Agent providers are injected through handlers. That keeps the work definition stable when models or vendors change.

## Research graph

`research_graph.py` is the first production-shaped workflow. It moves a Canadian technical-work research question through source discovery, evidence collection, capability extraction, contradiction review, evidence scoring, and curriculum-impact analysis. A proposed pathway change stops at a human curriculum gate. Research can inform a change autonomously; it cannot authorize one.

Run the tests from the repository root:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s runtime -p 'test_*.py' -v
```
